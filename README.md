# üõ†Ô∏è Backend Practice Project

This repository contains a backend project designed to deepen my understanding
of backend development. The project is built using **Node.js** and various
modern technologies to implement secure user authentication and management
functionalities. The project is currently in progress.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code
  server-side.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data and other application
  information.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **dotenv**: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file into
  `process.env`.
- **bcrypt**: A library for hashing passwords to enhance security.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used for securely transmitting information between
  parties as a JSON object.
- **Nodemailer**: A module to send emails, used here for user confirmation
  emails.
- **Postman**: A tool used to test API endpoints during development.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user sign-up, login, and password management.
- **Password Encryption**: User passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before
  storing in the database.
- **JWT Authentication**: User sessions are managed using JWT for secure and
  stateless authentication.
- **Email Confirmation**: Upon registration, users receive a confirmation email
  to activate their account.
- **API Testing with Postman**: All API endpoints are tested using Postman to
  ensure they work as expected.

## üöß Project Status

This project is still in progress. Future plans include:

- Implementing additional user roles and permissions.
- Enhancing error handling and validation.
- Adding more detailed API documentation.
